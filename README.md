# Barbie Cipher

Santa Clause never brought me a Barbie Typewriter E-118 (with cryptographic capabilities) when I was a kid, so to overcome my sadness I wrote this python library to code/decode messages using the typewriter own cipher tables.

_*tl;nr*_ This toy typewriter can code/decode messages kids type with a _mono alphabet substitution_ cipher. The manufacturer pre-loaded four different conversion tables.
